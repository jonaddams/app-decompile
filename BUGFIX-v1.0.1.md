# Bug Fix - Version 1.0.1

## Issue Reported
When launching `SDK Analyzer.app` and entering an iOS App Store URL, the following error appeared:
```
Analysis Failed
An error occurred during analysis:
sh: ./detect-sdk-ios.sh: No such file or directory
```

## Root Cause
The AppleScript was using incorrect path resolution to locate the backend shell scripts.

**Previous logic:**
```applescript
set appPath to path to me
set appPosixPath to POSIX path of appPath
set appDir to do shell script "dirname " & quoted form of appPosixPath
set scriptDir to appDir & "/.."  # This was incorrect
```

The issue: When the app bundle is at `/path/to/SDK Analyzer.app`, the `path to me` returns the path to the app bundle itself, not the MacOS executable inside it. Adding `"/.."` was going up too many levels.

## Solution
Fixed the path resolution to correctly identify the parent directory of the `.app` bundle:

**New logic:**
```applescript
set appPath to path to me
set appPosixPath to POSIX path of appPath
-- Remove trailing slash if present
if appPosixPath ends with "/" then
    set appPosixPath to text 1 thru -2 of appPosixPath
end if
-- Get parent directory of the .app bundle
set scriptDir to do shell script "dirname " & quoted form of appPosixPath
```

This correctly resolves to the directory containing `SDK Analyzer.app`, where the shell scripts are located.

## Files Modified
- `SDK-Analyzer.applescript` - Fixed path resolution in both `analyzeIOS()` and `analyzeAndroid()` functions
- `SDK Analyzer.app` - Recompiled with fixes
- `SDK-Analyzer-v1.0.zip` - Updated distribution package

## Testing
To verify the fix works:

1. **Place all files in the same directory:**
   ```
   /some/directory/
   ├── SDK Analyzer.app
   ├── detect-sdk-ios.sh
   ├── detect-sdk-android.sh
   ├── competitors.txt
   └── library-info.txt
   ```

2. **Double-click `SDK Analyzer.app`**

3. **Choose iOS (App Store)**

4. **Enter a valid App Store URL**

5. **Expected behavior:**
   - Notification: "Starting iOS app analysis..."
   - Analysis runs (may take 1-3 minutes)
   - Success dialog with "Open Report" button
   - No "file not found" errors

## Version History
- **v1.0** (2025-10-28 10:00) - Initial release
- **v1.0.1** (2025-10-28 11:02) - Fixed path resolution bug

## Current Status
✅ **FIXED** - App now correctly locates backend scripts
✅ **TESTED** - Path resolution verified
✅ **RELEASED** - Distribution ZIP updated

## Distribution
The updated `SDK-Analyzer-v1.0.zip` is ready for distribution with the fix applied.
