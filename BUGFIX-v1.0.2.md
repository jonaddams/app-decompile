# Bug Fix - Version 1.0.2

## Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Path Resolution Error
**Error:** `sh: ./detect-sdk-ios.sh: No such file or directory`

**Root Cause:** Incorrect path resolution in AppleScript

**Solution:** Fixed path resolution to correctly locate scripts in the same directory as the `.app` bundle

**Fixed in:** v1.0.1

---

### Issue #2: Homebrew Not Found When Running from GUI
**Error:**
```
ℹ️  Homebrew not found. Installing Homebrew...
Warning: Running in non-interactive mode because `stdin` is not a TTY.
Need sudo access on macOS (e.g. the user needs to be an Administrator)!
```

**Root Cause:**
When running shell scripts via AppleScript's `do shell script`, the PATH environment variable is minimal and doesn't include Homebrew's location (`/opt/homebrew/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`).

**Impact:**
- GUI app couldn't find `brew` command
- GUI app couldn't find `ipatool` command
- Script attempted to install Homebrew, requiring sudo (not possible from GUI)

**Solution:**
Added PATH initialization at the start of both shell scripts:

```bash
# Add Homebrew to PATH (needed when running from GUI apps)
# Check both Apple Silicon and Intel Mac locations
if [ -x "/opt/homebrew/bin/brew" ]; then
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
elif [ -x "/usr/local/bin/brew" ]; then
    eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
fi
```

This ensures that:
1. Homebrew is found on Apple Silicon Macs (`/opt/homebrew`)
2. Homebrew is found on Intel Macs (`/usr/local`)
3. Works from both Terminal and GUI environments
4. No sudo required if tools are already installed

**Fixed in:** v1.0.2

## Additional Improvements

### Better Error Messages
Enhanced error handling in the GUI app to detect and explain setup issues:

- ✅ Detects missing Homebrew installation
- ✅ Provides clear setup instructions
- ✅ Directs users to run Terminal commands for one-time setup
- ✅ Explains administrator access requirements

**Example error message:**
```
❌ Setup Required

Homebrew and ipatool need to be installed first.

Please run this one-time setup in Terminal:

1. Install Homebrew:
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

2. Install ipatool:
   brew install ipatool

3. Authenticate:
   ipatool auth login --email your@email.com

Then try this app again!
```

## Testing Checklist

To verify the fixes work:

### ✅ Test 1: Homebrew and ipatool Already Installed
1. Ensure Homebrew is installed: `which brew`
2. Ensure ipatool is installed: `which ipatool`
3. Ensure ipatool is authenticated: `ipatool auth info`
4. Double-click `SDK Analyzer.app`
5. Choose "iOS (App Store)"
6. Paste a valid App Store URL
7. Click "Analyze"
8. **Expected:** Analysis completes successfully without errors

### ✅ Test 2: Clean Environment (Missing Tools)
1. Temporarily rename Homebrew: `sudo mv /opt/homebrew /opt/homebrew.bak`
2. Double-click `SDK Analyzer.app`
3. Choose "iOS (App Store)"
4. Paste a valid App Store URL
5. Click "Analyze"
6. **Expected:** Clear error message with setup instructions
7. Restore Homebrew: `sudo mv /opt/homebrew.bak /opt/homebrew`

### ✅ Test 3: Command Line Still Works
1. Run: `./detect-sdk-ios.sh -u "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/example/id123"`
2. **Expected:** Works normally from Terminal

## Prerequisites for End Users

### Automatic (If Already Installed)
If Homebrew and ipatool are already installed and configured:
- ✅ Just double-click and use the app!
- ✅ No additional setup needed

### One-Time Setup (If Not Installed)
If this is a fresh Mac or tools aren't installed yet:

1. **Install Homebrew** (one-time):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install ipatool** (one-time):
   ```bash
   brew install ipatool
   ```

3. **Authenticate with Apple ID** (one-time):
   ```bash
   ipatool auth login --email your@email.com
   ```

After setup, the GUI app will work seamlessly!

## Support Notes

### For IT Administrators
When deploying to multiple users:

1. **Pre-install requirements on all Macs:**
   ```bash
   # Install Homebrew if not present
   which brew || /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

   # Install ipatool
   brew install ipatool
   ```

2. **Instruct users to authenticate:**
   - Each user must authenticate with their own Apple ID
   - Run: `ipatool auth login --email user@company.com`

3. **Distribute the app:**
   - Share `SDK-Analyzer-v1.0.zip`
   - Include `QUICK-START.md` guide
   - Mention prerequisites are pre-installed

### For End Users
- If you see setup errors, run the one-time setup commands
- Commands require internet connection
- Homebrew installation requires administrator password
- ipatool authentication uses your personal Apple ID

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Apple ID Requirements (iOS analysis only):**
   - Must have previously downloaded/purchased the app
   - App must be available in your Apple ID's region

2. **Administrator Access:**
   - Installing Homebrew requires admin password (one-time)
   - Running the app itself does NOT require admin access

3. **Platform:**
   - macOS only (10.15+)
   - Not available for Windows or Linux

---

**All issues resolved!** The app should now work smoothly when Homebrew and ipatool are installed.
