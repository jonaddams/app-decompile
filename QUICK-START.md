## üìç Where to Find Your Reports

- Look for files starting with `framework-analysis-` or `library-analysis-`
- They're text files you can open with any text editor
- Each report includes a timestamp in the filename

## ‚ùì Common Issues

### "Authentication Error" (iOS)
**Problem**: Your Apple ID login expired
**Solution**: Run the ipatool auth command again (see First-Time Setup above)

### "Download Error" (iOS)
**Problem**: Can't download the app
**Why**: The app must be:
- Previously downloaded/installed on one of your devices, OR
- Available in your country's App Store

**Solution**: Try with a free app you've already installed on your iPhone

### "App Won't Open"
**Problem**: macOS blocks the app
**Solution**:

2. Click "Open" in the warning dialog
3. Or go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Click "Open Anyway"

### "Permission Denied"

**Solution**: Ask your IT administrator or technical contact to run:
```bash
chmod +x detect-sdk-ios.sh detect-sdk-android.sh
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Keep everything together**: Don't move `SDK Analyzer.app` without also moving the other files
2. **Internet required**: iOS analysis downloads apps from the App Store
3. **Be patient**: Large apps take longer to analyze
4. **Check notifications**: Look for notifications in the top-right corner of your screen
