# SDK Analyzer - Installation Instructions

## üì• Step 1: Download & Extract

1. Download `SDK-Analyzer-v1.0.zip`
2. Double-click the ZIP to extract it
3. Move the folder to your Desktop or Documents

---

## üîì Step 2: Remove Security Block (First Time Only)

macOS will block the app because it's not signed. **This is safe - it's an internal tool.**

### Quick Fix (Recommended):

1. Open **Terminal** (find it in Applications ‚Üí Utilities)
2. Copy and paste this command:
   ```bash
   xattr -cr ~/Downloads/"SDK Analyzer.app"
   ```
   **Note:** Change `~/Downloads/` if you put the app in a different folder
3. Press **Enter**
4. Close Terminal

### Alternative Method:

1. **Right-click** on "SDK Analyzer.app"
2. Choose **"Open"** from the menu
3. Click **"Open"** in the dialog that appears

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Verify Setup (iOS Analysis Only)

Check if you have the required tools:

Open Terminal and run:
```bash
brew --version
ipatool --version
ipatool auth info
```

**If any command fails**, you need one-time setup:

```bash
# Install Homebrew (if needed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install ipatool (if needed)
brew install ipatool

# Authenticate with your Apple ID (if needed)
ipatool auth login --email your@email.com
```

**Android analysis** doesn't require these tools.

1. **Double-click** "SDK Analyzer.app"
2. Choose **iOS** or **Android**
3. Follow the prompts
4. Wait for analysis (1-5 minutes)

## üîí Is This Safe?

**Yes!** This is an internal tool for analyzing mobile apps. It:
- ‚úÖ Runs entirely on your Mac
- ‚úÖ Doesn't send data anywhere
- ‚úÖ Source code is available for inspection
- ‚úÖ Only analyzes apps you provide

The security warning appears because the app isn't signed with a paid Apple Developer certificate ($99/year). For internal tools, this is normal.

---

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Remove security block
xattr -cr "SDK Analyzer.app"

# Check if tools are installed
brew --version
ipatool --version
ipatool auth info

# Install tools (if needed)
brew install ipatool
ipatool auth login --email your@email.com
```
